# Problem
# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.

# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

# e.g. 86 is even because 86 Ã· 2 = 43

# 43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.

# e.g. 59 is odd because 59 Ã· 2 = 29.5

# 29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.

# The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.

# Expected output
# Example 1 Input
# 43
# Example 1 Output
# This is an odd number.

# CODE
#Â Which number do you want to check?
number = int(input())
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

if number%2==0:
  print("This is an even number.")
else:
  print("This is an odd number.")

# Teacher Solution
# # Which number do you want to check?
# number = int(input())

# # If the number can be divided by 2 with 0 remainder.
# if number % 2 == 0:
#   print("This is an even number.")
# # Otherwise (number cannot be divided by 2 with 0 remainder).
# else:
#   print("This is an odd number.")
