# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

# BMI Wikipedia Page

# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m)

# Example Input 1
# 1.75
# 80
# means: weight = 80 and height = 1.75

# Example Output 1
# 26
# Since: 80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837

# CODE
# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input()
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

h= float(height)
w= float(weight)
bmÄ± = (w/(h*h))
print(int(bmÄ±))

# teacher solution

# height = input()
# weight = input()
# # Your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# weight_as_int = int(weight)
# height_as_float = float(height)
# # Using the exponent operator **
# bmi = weight_as_int / height_as_float ** 2
# # or using multiplication and PEMDAS
# bmi = weight_as_int / (height_as_float * height_as_float)

# bmi_as_int = int(bmi)
# print(bmi_as_int)
