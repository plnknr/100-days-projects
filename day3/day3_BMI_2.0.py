# Problem
# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Equal to or over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Equal to or over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Equal to or over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Equal to or over 35 they are clinically obese.

#Expected Output
# Example Input 1
# 1.50
# 63
# Example Output 1
# Your BMI is 28.0, you are slightly overweight.
#   # matematical solution
# since 63 Ã· (1.50 x 1.50) = 28

# The testing code will check for print output that is formatted like one of the lines below:

# "Your BMI is 18.28678, you are underweight."
# "Your BMI is 22.0, you have a normal weight."
# "Your BMI is 28.50752, you are slightly overweight."
# "Your BMI is 32.56189, you are obese."
# "Your BMI is 37.50000, you are clinically obese."

#CODE

# Enter your height in meters e.g., 1.55
height = float(input())
# Enter your weight in kilograms e.g., 72
weight = int(input())
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

bmi = weight/ (height*height)
if bmi< 18.5:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.")
elif 18.5 <= bmi <25:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you have a normal weight.")
elif 25 <= bmi <30:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif 30 <= bmi <35:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are obese.")
else:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are clinically obese.")
